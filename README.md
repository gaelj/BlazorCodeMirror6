## Quick Start

- add the nuget package [GaelJ.BlazorCodeMirror6](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GaelJ.BlazorCodeMirror6/)
- Add `@using GaelJ.BlazorCodeMirror6`, `@using GaelJ.BlazorCodeMirror6.Commands` and `@using GaelJ.BlazorCodeMirror6.Models` in your `_Imports.razor` or page/component
- Use the `<CodeMirror6Wrapper />` component as demonstrated in `Examples.Common/Example.razor`

## Examples

See `Examples.Common/Example.razor`

JS / CSS resources are loaded automatically (nothing to add in `_Host.cshtml` / `index.html`).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions!

### Local installation

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gaelj/BlazorCodeMirror6.git`
- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npx: `npm install npx`
- For build issues: `run dotnet clean` followed by `dotnet build`

### Architecture

- The javascript-side initialization is in `CodeMirror6/NodeLib/src/index.ts`
- Interop from .Net to JS is in `CodeMirror6/CodeMirrorJsInterop.cs`
- Interop from JS to .Net is in `CodeMirror6Wrapper.razor.cs`
- The blazor component is in `CodeMirror6Wrapper.razor` and `CodeMirror6Wrapper.razor.cs`
- The example component is in `Examples.Common/Example.razor`

> The Node project is automatically built with the .Net project.

## FAQs / Troubleshooting

- If you have npm / rollup errors when building (for example after pulling recent changes), `dotnet clean` will delete the `node_modules` directory. Then run `dotnet build` again.

## Error reporting

Disclaimer: when a runtime error occurs in one of the demo / example projects, its details are sent to my private account on `Sentry.io`.

This is to help me detect and fix errors occurring on mobile platforms without the need for USB debugging, and to be informed of any errors that other users of the demo / example projects might encounter.

The component itself does not contain any tracking.

If you run the example projects locally and a runtime error occurs, some personal information will be sent to Sentry (OS, browser details, full path of the source file where the error occurred...)

If this makes you feel uncomfortable but you still wish to run the examples locally, you can disable Sentry by deleting:

- in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.WebHost.UseSentry(o => {
    o.Dsn = "https://d0ab79eee7b999c61d2c01fdf3958eeb@o4505402784546816.ingest.sentry.io/4506525909909504";
    // When configuring for the first time, to see what the SDK is doing:
    o.Debug = true;
    // Set TracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    o.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;
});
```

- in `Examples.BlazorWasm/wwwroot/index.html` (WASM example) or in `Examples.BlazorServer/Pages/_Host.cshtml` (Blazor Server example):

```html
<script
    src="https://js.sentry-cdn.com/d0ab79eee7b999c61d2c01fdf3958eeb.min.js"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```
